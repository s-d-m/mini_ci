# Mini CI

This project is a mini continuous integration system tailored to my own specific needs. If it also fits yours,
or you want to develop your own and take some inspiration from this, feel free to do so.

I developed this system since I wanted a CI system fitting the following requirements:

1. as simple to use as possible.
1. simple to tweak
1. with fast interactions
1. can run tests on embedded devices attached to a PC
1. extracting specific data should simple
1. automating tasks should be simple
1. possibility to follow the progression of a test execution live

All the systems out there were I looked at were failing at least one criteria. This is not to say they are
bad, only that I wasn't willing to compromise here and decided to rather roll my own for my specific needs.

More documentation about the project itself, for example the design choices, the security self-assessment or
the performance assessment is available at [https://s-d-m.github.io/mini_ci/](https://s-d-m.github.io/mini_ci/)
