# Implementation of the workers

## Language choice

There are no technical reasons to force the same technologies on the web server side as in the workers, however
`rust` fits the constraints of both, therefore there is also no reason to use two different programming
languages here either. For simplicity reason, `rust` stayed.

## Design

The tasks a worker can execute depend on the configuration of the machine itself. For example, if a static
analyser isn't installed on one machine, the worker executing on that machine can't obvioulsy perform the
task of running the static analyser on the developer's code.

Therefore the workers need to know which tasks
